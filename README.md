# How it works
It works by randomly selecting the word 'the' and replacing it with a term specified.
In the future, I'm hoping for a more user friendly way of specifying terms, but right now you will have to
change the array "words"

# How to use
Right now, there isn't an official way to use it. I'm currently using it as a Greasemonkey script, but am hoping to make it a Firefox addon
at some point.

# Why the name
It's just French for study
